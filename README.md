# Comparative-Analysis-of-Construction-Related-Air-Pollution-in-Indoor-and-Outdoor-Environments

The issue at hand revolves around assessing the impact of air pollution emanating from a construc-
tion site located approximately 300 meters away from residential buildings, particularly in terms of its
effect on human health. This problem is of paramount significance due to the potential health implica-
tions for residents living in proximity to the construction site. It also holds relevance for urban planners,
environmentalists, and policymakers striving to create sustainable and healthy living environments. Our
proposed solution involves deploying air quality monitoring devices both indoors and outdoors in adja-
cent blocks near the construction area, as well as in a non-constructional area for comparative analysis.
We aim to gauge various air quality parameters, including PM2.5, PM10, CO2 levels, temperature, and hu-
midity, and employ statistical tools like correlation coefficients and box plots for comprehensive assess-
ment. The preliminary findings indicate that the construction site not only impacts the closest block but
also extends its influence to a block further away, highlighting the far-reaching consequences of such ac-
tivities. These results underscore the urgency of addressing residentsâ€™ concerns regarding compromised
air quality and associated health risks. In essence, our solution provides valuable insights into the extent
of air pollution caused by construction operations, which can inform policies and practices for healthier
urban development.
